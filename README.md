# WhizBoard

WhizBoard is a collaborative brainstorming application designed to bring your team's ideas together in a seamless and interactive way. Drawing inspiration from platforms like Miro, WhizBoard provides a digital canvas where you can brainstorm, strategize, and visualize your ideas in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Brainstorm with your team in real-time, regardless of your geographical location. Changes made by users are instantly reflected on the board.
- **Interactive Canvas:** Draw, write, and add images or documents directly onto the canvas. The canvas is infinite, providing you with all the space you need to express your ideas.
- **Versatile Tools:** Use a variety of tools like sticky notes, shapes, lines, and text to capture and organize your thoughts.
- **Easy Navigation:** Navigate the board easily with pan and zoom functionality. You can also follow other users to see what they're working on.
- **Export and Share:** Export your boards to various formats like PDF or PNG. Share your boards with others, even if they don't have a WhizBoard account.
